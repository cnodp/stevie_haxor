There is so much to thank you for that we decided we needed more than the space on a plaque. From the incredible support and advocacy you have provided us to your participation in our naming ceremonies, you've been in our corner every step of the way. More than anything though, we wanted to thank you for the incredible job you've done building the culture of the squadron. When you arrived, we were still in the middle of COVID-19 procedures, with many folks still working from home and lots of virtual meetings. The squadron, to include the pwnies, desparately needed someone capable of reminding them what it means to be part of a team (or maybe, a pack). You were that person and your influence will live on in the squadron long after you depart.

Whether you reached this message using the shortcut or have a jpg open in notepad right now, please consider yourself an honorary Pwnie.
