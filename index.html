        Hi, I'm Stevie! Welcome to my hacker blog!
    </h1>

    <body>
        Today I discovered that rather than delete content or wait to push it out, I can simply make <br>
        it the same color as the background and then visitors to the site can't see it. Definitely don't <br>
        highlight the entire page though. That content isn't ready.
        <div>
            <img src="./stevie.jpg" alt="Stevie Haxor" height="600">
        </div>

        <div style="color:white">
            *DRAFT* I previously posted about using white text to hide content but I'm starting to think<br>
            that isn't the best way. Instead, I think it's probably better to make the content a comment, <br>
            then visitors would need to //Right Click -> View Page Source// or open developer options. Surely <br>
            no one would try that though! *DRAFT*
        </div>

    <!-- I'm really getting good at this hacker stuff. Today I learned about a thing called steganography,
    which is when you hide data within other data so that it's really hard to find. I tried it out by adding
    some text at the end of the image file on this page, and sure enough, it's really hard to find. Someone 
    would have to save the image and then be weird enough to open it in something like notepad or notepad++ 
    in order to read it. Nobody is that weird though... -->

    While it's more fun to find the messages, here is a 
    <a href ="thankyou.txt">shortcut to the end</a>
    just in case.
